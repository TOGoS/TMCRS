## What seems to work?

No shifting at all.  i.e. shift 0,0,1,1 by 0,0.
Found the structures we built.
Mobs intact (found Jason's cow pile).

Shifting 0,0,1,1 by 0,-1 seemed to work, minus entities.
Chests, etc had their proper contents.

## What doesn't seem to work?

After shifting a bunch of regions together, I encountered places in
the world where I came to an edge after which nothing was generated.
After dying, I would respawn in places with no ground.

This may have been due to terrain just taking a really long time to
generate because my computer was bogged down by some old, defunct
instances of Minecraft.  Needs more testing.

Entity data needs to be rewritten so that Pos is shifted.
