This seems to work without issue.

## Entity UUIDs

By default, TMCRS regenerates entity UUIDs.

Not doing so seems to result in entities colored very darkly
(appearing black unless you look real close).
I'm not sure why this is, and I'm not 100% convinced that it's
caused by keeping UUIDs, but there was a correlation there during
my (very limited) testing.

-keep-entity-uuids if you want to preserve them.  Only do this
if you are importing regions from another world and are sure that
those entities won't have doppelg√§ngers.

## To-do

Consistently work at chunk granularity:

- -error-on-conflict shouldn't trigger unless there is overlapping chunk
  data within overlapping regions.
- -keep should still write into existing region files where chunks are missing.

- Allow -bounds to be specified in chunks instead of regions.
